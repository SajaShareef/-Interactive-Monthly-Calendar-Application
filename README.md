# -Interactive-Monthly-Calendar-Application

This project is aimed at creating a MIPS-based calendar management system. The system allows users to view, edit, and manage appointments within a monthly calendar. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the calendar functionality, enabling users to add, edit, and view appointments for specific dates.

Functionality:

1. View Calendar: Users can view the calendar per day or per set of days or for a given slot in a given day.

2. View Statistics: Users can see the number of lectures (in hours), number of Office Hours (in hours), and the number of Meetings (in hours). Additionally, the program shows the average lectures per day and the ratio between the total number of hours reserved for lectures and the total number of hours reserved for Office Hours.
   
3. Add a New Appointment:Users provide the required information: day number, slot, and type. The program checks if there is a conflict with existing appointments.
   
4. Delete an Appointment:Users provide the required information: day number, slot, and type. If there are two slots of the same type, the program will delete the first one.
